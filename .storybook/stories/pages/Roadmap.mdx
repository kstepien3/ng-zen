# 🗺️ Roadmap

Welcome to the **@ng-zen/cli roadmap**! This page outlines our planned expansions, prioritized by **importance** (fundamental role in UI building) and **reusability** (how often components can be embedded in others). We focus on production-ready, customizable Angular elements that integrate seamlessly with existing components.

> **📝 Note**: This roadmap is not set in stone and may evolve based on community feedback, technical constraints, or new priorities. Items can be reordered, added, or removed as development progresses.

## 🎯 Why This Roadmap?

- **🚀 Importance**: Builds from core UI primitives (e.g., cards, modals) to advanced features (e.g., tables, wizards).
- **🔄 Reusability**: Prioritizes elements like icons and directives that enhance multiple components.
- **📊 Progress**: Existing components are marked ✅. Future ones are planned for upcoming releases.

## 🧩 Components

Components are the core UI building blocks. Existing ones are **✅ implemented** and available now.

### 🔥 High Importance

These are essential for most apps and highly reusable.

- **Icon** ✅ - SVG icon system; foundational for visual consistency in buttons, alerts, etc.
- **Button** ✅ - Interactive buttons with primary/secondary variants, loading states, and icons.
- **Input** ✅ - Text input fields with validation, prefixes/suffixes, and types.
- **Card** - Core layout container; reusable in modals, lists, and content sections.
- **Modal/Dialog** - Essential for user interactions, confirmations, and overlays; embeds cards and buttons.
- **Select/Dropdown** - Key for forms; uses icons and inputs for selections.
- **Tabs** - Navigation component; integrates buttons and icons for tabbed interfaces.
- **Accordion** - Collapsible content sections; uses icons and buttons for expansion.

### ⚖️ Medium Importance

Useful for enhanced UX and specific use cases.

- **Avatar** ✅ - User profile images and initials with fallback support.
- **Alert** ✅ - Informational messages with customizable styles and dismissible options.
- **Checkbox** ✅ - Form checkboxes with indeterminate state and validation.
- **Divider** ✅ - Visual separators, horizontal or vertical, with labels and custom thickness.
- **Form Control** ✅ - Form field wrapper with labels, validation messages, and indicators.
- **Switch** ✅ - Toggle controls with on/off states, disabled state, and custom labels.
- **Textarea** ✅ - Multi-line text inputs with auto-resize, character counts, and validation.
- **Progress Bar** - Loading feedback component; integrates with skeletons and modals.
- **Spinner** - Loading states; can be used in buttons, modals, and with directives.
- **Badge** - Status indicators and notifications; reusable in avatars and buttons.
- **Tooltip** - Contextual help; attaches to any element for guidance.
- **Breadcrumb** - Navigation aids; uses icons and links for path display.
- **Pagination** - Data list navigation; uses buttons and inputs for page controls.
- **Menu/Dropdown Menu** - Advanced navigation; uses icons and buttons for menus.
- **Sidebar** - Layout structure; embeds menus and icons for side navigation.
- **Table/Data Table** - Data display; uses pagination and inputs for sorting/filtering.
- **Skeleton** ✅ - Loading placeholders with animation and responsive shapes.

### 🧊 Low Importance

Nice-to-have for specialized apps.

- **Stepper/Wizard** - Multi-step flows; uses buttons and progress bars.
- **Toast/Notification** - Alert extensions for temporary messages.
- **Chip/Tag** - Labels for selections; reusable in inputs and selects.
- **Slider/Range** - Form input for ranges; extends form-control.
- **Date Picker** - Advanced date selection; uses inputs and modals.

## 🎣 Directives

Directives enhance behavior without adding DOM elements.

### 🔥 High Importance

- **Click Outside** - Handles modal/dropdown closing; highly reusable for UX.
- **Tooltip Directive** - Attaches tooltips to any element for better help.

### ⚖️ Medium Importance

- **Skeleton Loading** - Shows skeleton placeholders during async operations on containers.
- **Spinner Directive** - Overlays spinner on elements during actions.
- **Focus Trap** - Improves accessibility by trapping focus in modals.
- **Ripple Effect** - Adds button feedback animations on buttons and cards.

### 🧊 Low Importance

- **Auto Focus** - Automatically focuses form elements for better UX.
- **Debounce** - Optimizes input performance in searches and inputs.

## 🔧 Pipes

Pipes transform data for display.

### ⚖️ Medium Importance

- **Truncate** - Shortens text for display in cards and tooltips.
- **Date Format** - Formats dates for tables and inputs.
- **Currency** - Handles financial display in tables and inputs.

### 🧊 Low Importance

## ⚙️ Services

Services provide app-wide logic and state.

### 🔥 High Importance

- **Theme Service** - Manages global theming; affects all components via CSS variables.
- **Notification Service** - Handles toast and alert management across the app.

### ⚖️ Medium Importance

- **Breakpoint Service** - Provides responsive breakpoints for sidebars and modals.
